## Task
`IA6` : A simple grammar to convert raw(json/csv/tsv..etc) data into visual graphs(bar/line/pie charts ..etc).
eg :- "Draw Bar_graph for DataSource:AA with (X:time,Y:count) " will draw a bar graph for AA data source. you can use graph visualization js libraries like c3/d3 .. etc and conversion will be have this kind of flow. raw data (json/csv) + grammar ---> json object with suitable configurations ---> convert into graphs. Todo - design a suitable grammar, create a parser for that grammar and simple compiler to convert that strings into intermidiate json object.
